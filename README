Check that you have Python 2.5.x or 2.6.x available with command 'python -V'. 

In some environments that might be available via 'python25' or 'python26' 
commands in which case you need to use that one instead of plain 'python'.

To start using flexget from this directory, run the following commands:

python bootstrap.py
bin/flexget

This will initialize python virtualenv and install all required dependencies
in it.

You may also place the configuration files in ~/.flexget (Unix, Mac OS X) 
or C:\Documents and Setting\<username>\.flexget (Windows).

If you don't want to use virtualenv there's 'flexget_vanilla.py' file which
can be used to run FlexGet without bootstrapping, note that you will need to
install all required dependencies yourself.
