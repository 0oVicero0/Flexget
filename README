Check that you have Python2.5 available with command 'python -V'. In some
environments that might be available via 'python25' command in which case you need
to use that one instead of plain 'python'.

To start using flexget from this directory, run the following commands:

python bootstrap.py
bin/flexget

You may also place the configuration files in ~/.flexget (Unix, Mac OS X) or C:\Documents and Setting\<username>\.flexget (Windows).
