          high-concept action comedy follows Chuck Bartowski as the Buy More computer
          geek turned secret agent. When Chuck unwittingly downloads a database of
          government information and deadly fighting skills into his head, he becomes
          the CIA''s most vital secret. This sets Chuck on a path to become a full-fledged
          spy, assisted by the stoic Colonel John Casey; Chuck''s best friend, Morgan
          Grimes; and the CIA''s top agent (now Chuck''s wife) Sarah Walker. With
          the help of this unlikely team and his unorthodox techniques, Chuck is ready
          to take Operation Bartowski freelance. Chuck''s spy abilities will be put
          to a new test when he and his team must save mankind without the help of
          the CIA. Instead, they''ll use the cover of the Buy More electronics store
          to fund their own operations, leading to new missions, new stakes and new
          obstacles. With Chuck and Sarah as newlyweds and his family in on his secret,
          it has never been harder for Chuck to separate his spy life from his personal
          life.","first_aired":"2007-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","airs":{"day":"Friday","time":"20:00","timezone":"America/New_York"},"runtime":43,"certification":"TV-PG","network":"NBC","country":"us","trailer":null,"homepage":"http://www.nbc.com/Chuck/","status":"ended","rating":8.46609,"votes":8833,"updated_at":"2016-03-29T17:02:31.000Z","language":"en","available_translations":["en","de","pt","pl","bg","hu","fr","ja","he","da","zh","bs","sv","cs","tr","es","ru","it"],"genres":["comedy","drama","action"],"aired_episodes":91,"images":{"fanart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/395/fanarts/original/3eacbd81ca.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/395/fanarts/medium/3eacbd81ca.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/395/fanarts/thumb/3eacbd81ca.jpg"},"poster":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/395/posters/original/446ea0bd1f.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/395/posters/medium/446ea0bd1f.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/395/posters/thumb/446ea0bd1f.jpg"},"logo":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/395/logos/original/843c10442e.png"},"clearart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/395/cleararts/original/48a24c250f.png"},"banner":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/395/banners/original/cba796b22e.jpg"},"thumb":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/001/395/thumbs/original/88250c9da0.jpg"}}}'}
