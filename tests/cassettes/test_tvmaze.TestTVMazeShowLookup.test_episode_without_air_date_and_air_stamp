        job is more stressful, dangerous or exhilarating than those of the Firefighters,
        Rescue Squad and Paramedics of Chicago Firehouse 51. These are the courageous
        men and women who forge headfirst into danger when everyone else is running

        These are their stories.\"</em></p><p>From renowned Emmy Award-winning executive
        producer Dick Wolf and creators Derek Haas and Michael Brandt comes season
        four of the high-octane drama \"Chicago Fire\" - an edge-of-your-seat view
        into the lives of everyday heroes committed to one of America''s noblest professions.
        For the firefighters, rescue squad and paramedics of Chicago Firehouse 51,
        no occupation is more stressful or dangerous, yet so rewarding and exhilarating.
        These courageous men and women are among the elite who forge headfirst into
        danger when everyone else is running the other way and whose actions make
        the difference between life and death.</p><p>The pressure to perform on such
        a high level has a way of taking a personal toll, sometimes putting team members
        from the Truck and the specially trained Rescue Squad at odds with each other.
        Despite any differences, this is an extended family, and when it''s \"go time,\"
        everyone inside Firehouse 51 knows no other way than to lay it all on the
        line for each other. Lt. Matthew Casey (Jesse Spencer) leads the Truck Company,
        and brash Lt. Kelly Severide (Taylor Kinney) runs the Rescue Squad.</p><p>The
        firehouse also includes Battalion Chief Wallace Boden (Eamonn Walker), a fireman''s
        fireman who recently welcomed a newborn son with his wife, Donna (Melissa
        Ponzio). As chief of the firehouse, it''s Boden''s job to keep everything
        in line and running smoothly between truck and squad. Paramedic turned tough-as-nails
        firefighter Gabriela Dawson (Monica Raymund) returns alongside Paramedic Sylvie
        Brett (Kara Killmer) and seasoned veteran Christopher Herrmann (David Eigenberg).
        Dora Madison also joins the cast as spunky, spirited paramedic Jessica \"Chili\"
        Chilton.</p><p>Also returning for the fourth season are Randy \"Mouch\" McHolland
        (Christian Stolte), Jose Cruz (Joe Minoso) and Brian \"Otis\" Zvonecek (Yuri
        Sardarov).</p><p>In addition to Wolf, Haas and Brandt, executive producers
        also include Matt Olmstead, Joe Chappelle, Danielle Gelber, Arthur Forney
        and Peter Jankowski.</p><p>\"Chicago Fire\" is produced by Universal Television
        and Wolf Films.</p>","updated":1449563509,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/59"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/432941"},"nextepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/432942"}}}}]'}
