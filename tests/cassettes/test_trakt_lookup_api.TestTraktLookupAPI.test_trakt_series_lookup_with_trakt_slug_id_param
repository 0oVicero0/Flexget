        as the Flash, and his sidekick Wally West, otherwise known as Kid Flash, battle
        evil villains and aliens who try to cause mayhem on Earth. They can outrun
        a bullet, vibrate through solid walls, and do all sorts of other things with
        their incredible speed. When there is trouble, Barry and Wally open up their
        rings which shoot out their costumes.","first_aired":"1967-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","airs":{"day":"Saturday","time":null,"timezone":"Europe/London"},"runtime":7,"certification":null,"network":"CBS","country":null,"trailer":null,"homepage":null,"status":"ended","rating":5.0,"votes":1,"updated_at":"2016-01-27T10:30:38.000Z","language":null,"available_translations":[],"genres":["animation"],"aired_episodes":3,"images":{"fanart":{"full":null,"medium":null,"thumb":null},"poster":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/075/481/posters/original/0782d34337.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/075/481/posters/medium/0782d34337.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/shows/000/075/481/posters/thumb/0782d34337.jpg"},"logo":{"full":null},"clearart":{"full":null},"banner":{"full":null},"thumb":{"full":null}}}'}
