        a particle accelerator causes a freak storm, CSI Investigator Barry Allen
        is struck by lightning and falls into a coma. Months later he awakens with
        the power of super speed, granting him the ability to move through Central
        City like an unseen guardian angel. Though initially excited by his newfound

        using their new powers for good. Barry partners with S.T.A.R. Labs and dedicates
        his life to protect the innocent. For now, only a few close friends and associates
